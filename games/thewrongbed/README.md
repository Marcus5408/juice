# The Wrong Side of the Bed

**Team Members:** [Issac Liu](https://github.com/Marcus5408) and [Lubaba Nawla](https://github.com/lubabanawla)

**One Sentence Pitch:** You’re an insomniac and you’ve been having trouble sleeping - However, the moment you finally sleep you start experiencing strange dreams *(or are they dreams?)* You have to escape each dream to somehow, maybe - just maybe - wake up.

**Fun Key Mechanic:** There will be quick-time events that require the player to react quickly to certain events that happen in the dreams.

**Core Game Loop:** The player enters a dream and must “fix” the dream by returning the dream to a “correct” state, which causes the player to fall asleep in the dream and wake up in the next dream.

**Engaging Element:** The dreams become progressively more unexpected and illogical.

**Scope of Game:** There will be six dreams to play through, each lasting approximately five minutes.
